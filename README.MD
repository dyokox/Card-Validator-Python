## Card Validator
### Summary
This is a _Card Validator_ which is accepts a card number of 16 digits from the user, does a few steps which are explained in the code itself, and tells the user if the card # is valid or not.

It was a fun quick project in python to remember it, and its nothing spectacular. 

The _idea_ came from Twitter, saw an image of how card numbers are validated and I decided to try because I can.
